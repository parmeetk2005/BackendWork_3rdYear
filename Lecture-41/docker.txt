docker: is a tool which packs our application in a container which is independent and that container/docker has everything to run that application
    image vs container: container is running instance image is the blueprint of the container
    container is formed after running the image
JARGON:
    docker engine: software 
    docker cli: 
    docker registry: images stored (registry is like github repo)




DOCKER COMMANDS
    docker images
    docker pull <image-name> (to download id not in local system)
    docker run <image-name> 
        -> use flags
            => -d (-detach -> to run container in detach form like process is running in background and in same time we can use terminal)
            => -p (port mapping)
            => docker ps (list all container which are currently running)
            => docker kill <container id> (to kill the container)
            => --name <name> (to give the name to the container i gave name pk_mongodb)
            => docker exec -it <container name/ container id> (like docker exec -it pk_mongodb ./bin/bash)


to create image :
    docker build -t <image-name>:<tags>

image size will be too large and we will be aksed to reduce the image size
    (1) reduce size of node moldules
    (2) remove dependencies in package.json
    (3) change the image from latest to smallest size one
    [build everytime u change the file]
