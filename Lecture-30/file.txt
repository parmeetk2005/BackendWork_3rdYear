WEBSOCKET -> communication protocol -> http (bidirectional data communication)

browser -> http
browser <- http (then server break)

connection is persistent (means connection will not break and without client req server can send response), full-duplex communication (two way channel between client and server), over 1 tcp connection

server cannot send any response until and unless req is sent

example: stock exchange:-  http send req and socket send message
(real time communication)

server driven thing is done by websocket

polling if u dont want to use websocket, like after some intervals if we want to send the req (we cannot do 30 lakh req work by polling) leetcode use polling bcz one user only send 3-4 req but in stock exchange price change in milli sec and we have to send soo many req in 1 min for 1 user so it cant be dont by polling



socket.io -> its not websocket protocol but its protocol uske uper bna huya that is made by 3rd person support is not everywhere
